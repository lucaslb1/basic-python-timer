#### What does it do?
The user can switch between a timer and stopwatch(not implemented yet) using the menu

The timer allows the user to input a time in seconds into a box. When the timer is pressed a visual countdown will start.
Once it reaches zero a finished message will appear and a alarm tone will go off. A new timer can then be started and
started again.

The stopwatch has a start button and will count up from zero. There is a stop and reset button.

#### How do I run it?
You must have python 3. Currently, audio will only play on mac or windows(untested).
Once in the folder run the command
`python3 TimeApp.py`
or
`python TimeApp.py`

#### Feedback
If you have any feedback it would be greatly appreciated. This is a beginner project I am using to teach myself python.
